# NOTE
#   This cannot be a reusable workflow, as trusted publishing requires
#   "permissions: id-token: write" and this is forbidden for
#   reusable workfows.
#   This workflow is therefore generally not used. Instead, we use
#   publish_on_release which contains the same steps, but is triggered
#   by a release.
